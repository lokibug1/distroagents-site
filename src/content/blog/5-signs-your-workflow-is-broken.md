# 5 Signs Your Workflow is Broken (Not Your People)

Here's a pattern we see in nearly every distribution company we talk to:

The owner or ops manager thinks they have a people problem. The team is dropping balls, orders are getting delayed, invoices are stuck, and customers are frustrated.

But when we dig in, it's almost never a people problem. It's a workflow problem.

Your team isn't failing you. Your processes are failing them. Here's how to tell the difference.

## 1. The Same Information Lives in 3+ Places

A distributor posted in r/procurement recently: *"A vendor submitted an invoice 6 days ago and it's stuck somewhere between three inboxes."*

Sound familiar?

When the same information (an order, a price, a customer request) has to be manually entered or forwarded across multiple systems, ERP, email, spreadsheet, whiteboard, errors aren't occasional. They're guaranteed.

**The test**: Pick any customer order from last week. How many systems was it touched in? How many times was the same data manually re-entered?

If the answer is more than two, you don't have a data entry problem. You have an integration problem.

**What to do about it**: The fix isn't telling people to be more careful. It's connecting the systems so information flows once. An order that comes in via email should hit your ERP without someone copying and pasting line items.

## 2. Your Best People Spend Most of Their Time on Routine Work

Your best sales rep is spending 3 hours a day entering orders instead of selling. Your best AR person is making collection calls that are 90% "just checking in" reminders. Your ops manager is manually checking inventory levels instead of planning.

When skilled people spend their time on tasks that follow a script, that's a workflow failure.

**The test**: Ask your top three people to track their time for one day. What percentage was spent on work that requires their judgment and experience vs. work that follows a repeatable pattern?

If more than 50% is routine, you're paying expert rates for clerical work, not because your people are slacking, but because the workflow gives them no alternative.

**What to do about it**: Separate judgment work from routine work. Routine work (standard order entry, reminder calls, data lookups) should be automated or handled by AI agents. Your people should spend their time on exceptions, relationships, and decisions.

## 3. Knowledge Lives in One Person's Head

What happens when Maria from AR goes on vacation? What happens if your pricing manager leaves?

If the answer is "things fall apart," you have a workflow problem. Critical processes shouldn't depend on tribal knowledge. If the only person who knows how to handle a short-pay is the person who's been doing it for 15 years, your workflow has a single point of failure.

**The test**: Could a new hire follow your collection process without Maria explaining it? Is your pricing logic documented somewhere other than a spreadsheet on Dave's desktop?

**What to do about it**: This isn't about creating 50-page process documents nobody reads. It's about encoding the logic into systems. Collection cadences, pricing rules, approval thresholds. These should be in a system, not in someone's head. When you automate a workflow, you're also documenting it.

## 4. Exceptions Are the Norm

Every distributor has edge cases. But when your team spends more time handling "exceptions" than standard processes, the exceptions have become the process, you just haven't updated the workflow to reflect it.

Common signs:

- More than 20% of orders require manual intervention
- Pricing overrides happen daily instead of weekly
- Your team has workarounds for workarounds (the sticky note on the monitor that explains the spreadsheet that supplements the ERP)

**The test**: Track how many orders or transactions this week required someone to deviate from the "standard" process. If it's more than 1 in 5, your standard process doesn't match your actual business.

**What to do about it**: Map the real process, not the ideal one. Then decide: should the exception become the new standard (update the workflow), or is it a genuinely rare case (build an escalation path)? Most "exceptions" are just patterns you haven't formalized.

## 5. You Can't Measure What Matters

Ask most distribution operations managers these questions and they can't answer quickly:

- What's your average order processing time?
- How many invoices are past 60 days?
- What percentage of quotes have margin below your target?
- How many orders shipped with errors last month?

If getting these answers requires pulling data from three systems and building a spreadsheet, your workflow isn't instrumented. You're operating blind and only finding problems after they've cost you money.

**The test**: Can you answer the four questions above in under 5 minutes using existing systems?

**What to do about it**: Measurement should be a byproduct of the workflow, not a separate project. When orders flow through a system (not inboxes), you get processing time data automatically. When collections follow a defined cadence, you see aging metrics in real-time. When pricing is enforced by rules, you know your margin health instantly.

## The Bigger Picture

Here's the uncomfortable truth: most distributors are running 2026 businesses on 2010 workflows. The ERP has been updated, maybe the WMS too, but the actual processes, how orders flow, how collections happen, how pricing gets managed, haven't evolved.

Your people have been compensating for broken workflows by working harder, staying later, and building creative workarounds. That's not a sustainable strategy. It's how you burn out your best people.

The fix isn't hiring more people to work around the same broken processes. It's fixing the processes.

## Where to Start

Pick the sign that resonated most. That's your starting point.

If it's **#1 (information in multiple places)**: Start by connecting your order intake to your ERP.

If it's **#2 (best people doing routine work)**: Start by automating your most repetitive AR or order entry task.

If it's **#3 (knowledge in one person's head)**: Start by encoding your pricing or collection logic into a system.

If it's **#4 (exceptions are the norm)**: Start by mapping your real process vs. your documented process.

If it's **#5 (can't measure what matters)**: Start with a single dashboard that shows your order-to-cash cycle.

One change. One workflow. Prove it works, then expand.
