# How to Evaluate AI Tools Without Burning Millions

A Reddit post recently went viral in r/procurement: *"My company blew millions on an inadequate AI tool."* The thread exploded with similar stories, distributors who bought flashy demos, endured 18-month implementations, and ended up with tools their teams refused to use.

This isn't an AI problem. It's an evaluation problem.

Here's the framework we recommend to every distributor considering AI, whether you buy from us or not.

## Why Most AI Evaluations Fail

The typical pattern looks like this:

1. Executive sees a demo at a trade show
2. Vendor promises 10x ROI with a six-figure contract
3. IT spends 12 months on integration
4. End users hate it because it doesn't match their workflows
5. Tool gets shelfwared, budget gets blamed

The core mistake? **Evaluating AI tools like software purchases instead of operational hires.**

You wouldn't hire a warehouse manager based on a PowerPoint. You'd watch them work. AI tools deserve the same scrutiny.

## The 5-Point Evaluation Framework

### 1. Start With a Single Pain Point

Don't buy a "platform." Pick the one workflow that causes the most pain and costs the most money. For most distributors, this is one of:

- **AR collections**, invoices aging past 60 days
- **Order entry**, manual processing from calls, emails, texts
- **Pricing errors**, margin leakage from incorrect quotes
- **Compliance gaps**, missing documentation, failed audits

One pain point. One pilot. One measurable outcome.

### 2. Demand a Pilot Before a Contract

Any vendor unwilling to run a 30-day pilot on real data is selling vaporware. A proper pilot should:

- Use **your actual data** (not synthetic demos)
- Run on **a real subset** of your operations (one customer segment, one product category)
- Have **clear success metrics** defined upfront (e.g., "reduce average collection time from 45 days to 30 days")
- Require **minimal IT involvement** to set up

If the vendor needs 6 months and a dedicated integration team just to run a pilot, that tells you everything about what production will look like.

### 3. Test With Your Worst Data

Every distributor has messy data, duplicate customers, inconsistent SKU naming, pricing spreadsheets that haven't been audited in years. That's not a bug; that's reality.

The right AI tool handles messy data gracefully. The wrong one collapses.

Ask the vendor: *"What happens when the customer name doesn't match across our ERP and email? What happens when the PO references an obsolete SKU?"* If the answer is "you'll need to clean your data first," walk away. You'll be cleaning data forever.

### 4. Measure Output, Not Features

Vendors love feature lists. Distributors need results. Here's what to actually measure during a pilot:

| What to Measure | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| Time to first value | Can you see results in days, not months? |
| Accuracy rate | What % of actions are correct without human intervention? |
| Exception handling | How does it escalate when it's uncertain? |
| Team adoption | Do your people actually use it, or work around it? |
| Integration depth | Does it work with your ERP, or does it need a parallel system? |

The best metric is the simplest: **did the specific pain point get measurably better?**

### 5. Check the Integration Story

Distribution runs on ERPs, Eclipse, Prophet 21, SAP, Epicor, NetSuite. If the AI tool can't read from and write to your ERP in real-time, it's a toy.

Questions to ask:

- Do you have a native connector for our ERP, or do we need middleware?
- Can the tool write back to our system (create orders, update AR, adjust prices), or is it read-only?
- What happens during ERP upgrades or patches?
- How do you handle our custom fields and business rules?

## Red Flags to Watch For

Watch for these during any AI vendor conversation:

- **"We'll customize it for you"**. Translation: the product doesn't work for distribution out of the box, and customization will take a year.
- **"You need to clean your data first"**. Translation: our tool can't handle real-world messiness.
- **"ROI depends on full deployment"**. Translation: we can't show value on a small pilot.
- **"Our AI learns over time"**. Translation: it doesn't work well now and we're hoping it'll get better.
- **Annual contracts with no pilot**. They know you'll discover it doesn't work, so they lock you in first.

## What Good Looks Like

A properly evaluated AI deployment for a distributor should look like this:

- **Week 1**: Connect to your ERP and email systems
- **Week 2**: Run the agent on a defined subset of operations
- **Week 3-4**: Measure results against the pre-defined metrics
- **Decision**: Expand, adjust, or walk away, based on data, not promises

No 18-month implementations. No million-dollar bets. Start small, prove value, then scale.

## The Bottom Line

The distributors who succeed with AI aren't the ones who spend the most. They're the ones who evaluate the hardest. Pick one pain point, demand a real pilot, measure real outcomes, and don't sign anything until the tool has proven itself on your data.

The AI tools that work for distribution are the ones built for distribution, not generic platforms that need a year of customization to understand what a catch weight is.
